Avoid the Bug HTML5 & Javascript game
-------------------------------------
by Dimitrios Kourkoulis

This is the source code of the Avoid the Bug game, which can be found at
http://dimitros.net/games/avoidthebug. The current version of the game has 
been developed in HTML5 and Javascript, but it is a port of an older version 
I had developed in Actionscript. I have placed the code here for anyone who
would like to use it as an example, in order to create a simple game like it.

It is not very sophisticated but, reading through it, you can easily find out
about how to put together some animations, movement, basic collision detection
and game logic. Oh, and you can explore the bug's superior AI :)

Enjoy!
